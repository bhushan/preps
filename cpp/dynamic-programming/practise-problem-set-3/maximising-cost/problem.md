# Description
You are given a non-empty string S consisting of lower case characters. You can change at most K letters to maximise the cost. If in the final string, X immediately precedes Y, you get an increase in cost by C. You have to determine the maximum cost possible.


## Input Format
The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains string S and an integer K - the number of characters you can change at most.

The second line of each test case contains M - the number of cost values.

The following M lines contain two space-separated integers along with a character X Y C - you get an increase in cost by C if X immediately precedes Y.


## Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer denoting the maximum cost possible on a separate line.

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100 where |S| denotes the length of the string S

0 ≤ K ≤ 100

0 ≤ M ≤ 676

‘a’ ≤ X, Y ≤ ‘z’

-1000  ≤ C ≤ 1000

It is guaranteed that no pair X Y is mentioned twice in the input data.

### Sample Output 1
```
155
0
100
```

### Note
For the first test case, change string to adcbz, cost becomes 100+55 = 155

For the second test case, changing any character will result in negative cost, we don’t change the original string/we can change the string so that e,a and c,v are not adjacent.

For the third test case, change string to yzcd, cost becomes 100.
